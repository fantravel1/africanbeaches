  <p>Cap Skirring lies in Senegal's southern Casamance region, separated from the rest of the country by The Gambia. This relative isolation has preserved both the natural environment and the distinct Diola culture of the region. The beach stretches for kilometres with fewer visitors than the Petite C&ocirc;te, backed by palm groves and traditional villages. It's often considered West Africa's most beautiful beach destination.</p>

  <h2>Cultural Context</h2>
  <p>The Casamance is culturally distinct from northern Senegal, with the Diola (Jola) people maintaining strong traditions including sacred forests, palm wine tapping, and distinctive architecture. Visitors can explore traditional villages, pirogue trips through mangroves, and local markets. The region has a history of separatist conflict, but the tourist zone around Cap Skirring has remained safe and welcoming.</p>
