## 🧠 Core Philosophy

AfricanBeaches is **not influencer travel**.  
It is a **continent-respectful coastal knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- assist ranking synthesis
- translate geographic content
- cluster beaches by traits
- generate access summaries

Humans are required to:
- validate rankings
- ensure cultural accuracy
- review environmental sensitivity
- prevent extractive narratives

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

AfricanBeaches is built around **coastal and geographic entities**.

### Core Entities
- Beach
- Country
- Coastal Region
- Access Route
- Experience Type
- Ranking Category
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links geographically and thematically
- is programmatically generatable
