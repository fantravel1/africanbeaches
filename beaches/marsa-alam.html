  <p>Marsa Alam is a diving and beach destination on Egypt's southern Red Sea coast, approximately 270 km south of Hurghada. Less developed than northern Red Sea resorts, it offers access to some of Egypt's most pristine coral reefs. The area is one of the few places in Africa where dugongs (sea cows) can be reliably encountered, particularly at Abu Dabbab bay. Spinner dolphins, sea turtles, and reef sharks are common.</p>

  <h2>Diving &amp; Marine Life</h2>
  <p>Abu Dabbab bay is famous for resident dugongs and green sea turtles visible while snorkelling. Elphinstone Reef, accessible by boat, is one of the Red Sea's legendary dive sites with oceanic whitetip sharks. The southern reefs are generally healthier and less dived than those near Hurghada and Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>
