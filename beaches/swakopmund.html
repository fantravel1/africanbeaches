  <p>Swakopmund is Namibia's premier coastal town, a surreal blend of German colonial architecture, Bavarian-style buildings, and surrounding Namib Desert dunes. Founded in 1892 as German South West Africa's main harbour, the town retains a distinctly European character incongruously set against African desert and cold Atlantic fog. The beaches are scenic but the water is cold; the town's appeal lies in its adventure activities, unique atmosphere, and gateway status to the Skeleton Coast and Sossusvlei.</p>
