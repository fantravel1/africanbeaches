  <p>Clifton comprises four numbered beaches (1st to 4th) tucked into coves beneath Lion's Head on Cape Town's Atlantic Seaboard. Sheltered from the notorious Cape southeaster wind by granite boulders and steep cliffs, Clifton offers calmer conditions than nearby Camps Bay. The beaches are famous for their white sand, affluent atmosphere, and spectacular sunset views. 4th Beach is the largest and most popular.</p>
